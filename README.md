## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2019 to better understand:

1. What are the main reasons developers visit Stack Overflow?
2. How often do developers visit Stack Overflow to get coding help?
3. How accurate are coding solutions on Stack Overflow in general? Does it save time compared to other resources available?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is 1 jupyter notebook `StackOverflow_Analysis2019.ipynb` added on this github project to demonstrate work related to the above questions.  Each of the above target questions are explored within this notebook along with comments and Markdown cells to guide through the thought process at each stage of the analysis.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@rsyed1/is-stack-overflow-the-best-tool-to-demystify-code-d08d196eb03).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Stack Overflow for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the Kaggle link available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/mchirico/stack-overflow-developer-survey-results-2019).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
